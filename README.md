# Android Color Picker

This is an Andorid color picker dialog that allows the user to select one or multiple colors.
It's a fork of the [Google's calendar color picker][ColorPickerGoogle], which was re-written and
additional functionality was added, notably the **ablity to select multiple colors**.
